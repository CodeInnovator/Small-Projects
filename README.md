# Mega Project List
This contains my solutions to the some of the problems in the [Mega Project List](https://github.com/CodeInnovator/Projects)

1.Find PI to the Nth Digit - Problem: Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
 My solution: [PitoNthDigits.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/PitoNthDigits.java)(Last Updated: Oct.9. 2015).

2.Find e to the Nth Digit -
Problem: Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
 My solution: [EtoNthDigits.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/EtoNthDigits.java)(Last Updated: Oct.10. 2015).

3.Fibonacci Sequence - 
Problem: Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
 My solution: [Fibonacci.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/Fibonacci.java)(Last Updated: Oct.12. 2015).

4.Prime Factorization- 
Problem: Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them. 
 My solution: [PrimeFact.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/PrimeFact.java) (Last Updated: Oct.15. 2015).

5.Next Prime Number -
Problem: Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one. 
 My solution:[NextPrimeNumber.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/NextPrimeNumber.java) (Last Updated: Oct.16. 2015).

6.Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor -
Problem: Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
My Solution: [TileCostEstimator.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/TileCostEstimator.java) (Last Updated: Oct.18. 2015).

7.Mortgage Calculator -
Problem: Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).
My Solution: N/A 

8.Change Return Program -
Problem: The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.
My Solution:[ChangeReturn.java,](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/ChangeReturn.java) (Last Updated: Oct.20. 2015) [NonNegativeException.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/NonNegativeException.java) (Last Updated: Oct.20. 2015).

9.Binary to Decimal and Back Converter -
Problem: Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.[DecimalConverter.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/ChangeReturn.java) (Last Updated: Oct.21. 2015).

10.Factorial Finder - The factorial of a positive integer n is defined as the product of the sequence , n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of 0 is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.[FactorialFinder.js](FactorialFinder.js) (Last Updated: Nov.6. 2015).

11.Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.[collatz.js](collatz) (Last Updated: Nov.27. 2015)

12.Sorting - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble Sort. [Sorting.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/Sorting.java) (Last Updated: Dec.8.2015)

13.Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.[FizzBuzz.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/FizzBuzz.java) (Last updated: Dec.15.2015)

14.Reverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out. [Reverse.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/Reverse.java) (Last updated: Dec.15.2015)

15.Pig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.[PigLatin.java](JavaMegaProjectList/src/numbers/JavaMegaProjectList/codeInnovator/PigLatin.java) (Last updated: Dec.15.2015)
